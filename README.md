# Some-few-basic-codes-to-solve-the-problem
1. Reverse your String : Write a function called ReveX that takes a string as input, and return a new string with the same letters in reverse order. Don’t use the .reverse() method, that would be too simple.
2. Solve the Factorial : Write a method called FactorX that takes an integer n a input and returns its factorial. Remember the formula of a factorial of a number.
3. The Longest word :Write a function called longest that takes a string (preferably a sentence) as input and returns the longest word in the string. You may assume that the string contains only letters and spaces.
4. Sum over my predecessors :Write a function called SumOverX that takes an integer as input and returns the sum over all the integers between zero and that integer, including it.
5. Four Digits Magic : Take any four-digit number,x. Rearrange the digits to make the largest possible number called xmax . Also rearrange the digits to make the smallest possible number, xmin . There is only one four-digit number for which.
6. From minutes to Conventional Time : Write a function called ClockX that takes as input a certain number of minutes, and returns a string that formats the number into ‘hours:minutes‘.
7. Vowel Digger : Write a function called VoweX that takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels in the string. You may assume that all the letters are lower cased. You can treat ”y” as a consonant.
8. Military Time : Write a function called Military that takes the time as string in AM/PM format and convert it to military (24-hour) time. Note: Midnight is 12:00:00AM on a 12-hour clock, and 00:00:00 on a 24-hour clock. Noon is 12:00:00PM on a 12-hour clock, and 12:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.
9. Plot over a summation
